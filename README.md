##How can I help?
There are two areas in which everyone can contribute quite easily.
You can either improve airports using the World Editor (WED). See https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/ for more information.
Also, improving the available landcover data by contributing to OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org) helps improving this scenery a lot.
Thank you!
